### TODO's:

- [ ] human/agent/tab-completion types is not super accurate, as well as agent sub types (composer, cmdk)
- [ ] no diff table, seems too limting, rather interactions ... then diff
- [ ] collect human terminal commands as well, input <> output
- [ ] extra fields to define step i to j is atempting a task
- [ ] ask for committing current changes to start collection to avoid stale entry points for the initial environment
- [ ] collect agent thinking traces, tool calls as well
- [ ] tab completion, should store human and agents parts separately.
- [ ] can we expand this to codex/claude code usage?
- [ ] Make the dashboard
